# Dear Momentive!

Thanks for the opportunity. Unfortunately, our conversation forced me to itch a scratch and finish up what I would consider 'closer' to the 'right way'. So, I spent (honest!) a couple of hours with a keyboard / google / react.

Instructions:

`npm i`
`npm start`

Features:
- API call to grab pics
- `useReducer` for state
- image selection
- in-memory searching
